# R Test

Assignment: complete the exercises.R file. You are supposed to write code where it says "# your code". The rest of the code can (and probably should) be taken as given. 

To test your code, you can run the script test_exercises.R. Note that there are while loops in your exercises, so make sure those terminate before you test your code, otherwise you will get stuck in an infinite loop.

When you are done, submit ONLY the exercises.R script as an attachment to this assignment.

Deadline: 12am (midnight).
