# Suppose you put $1,000 in an investment fund that will exhibit the following
# annual returns in the next 10 years: 9% 18% 10% 7% 2% 17% -8% 5% 9% 33%. 

# Show how much money your investment will be worth at the end of each year for
# the next 10 years, assuming returns are re-invested every year. 
# We give the answer with a general function called myinvestment.
# The function takes the arguments: 
# - investment (number)
# - returns_vector (numeric vector): for example, c(.09,.18,.10).

# Hint: If an investment returns e.g. 4% per year, it will be worth 1.04 times 
# as much after one year, 1.04 * 1.04 times as much after two years, 
# 1.04 * 1.04 * 1.04 times as much after three years, etc.
# Hint 2: explore the cumprod() function.

# Law of Large Numbers and Expected Values
# Assume "x" is a numeric vector, and "p" a numeric vector of probabilities.
# When "type" is "discrete", the expected value is (x_1*p_1 + ... + x_n*p_n)
# When "type" is "continuous", we use the Probability Integral Transform
# to simulate 1 million draws of X and approximate the expected value with the
# sample average (due to the LLN). 
# Hint: simulate 1 million draws from a uniform distribution and 
# use the inverse CDF function (icdf) to get the corresponding simulated values of X.
# Hint2: "type" can only be "discrete" or "continuous", but we want to let the user
# input only "D" for "discrete" or "C" for continuous. You may use match.arg().

# We are going to draw many paths from a brownian motion. 
# The first thing to note is that a brownian motion is just a cumulative sum
# of normal random variables (mean 0, sd  1). 
# For this exercise we will ignore that the initial value of a BM is zero.
# The function brownian_paths takes the following arguments:
# - nsim: number of simulations
# - N: number of observations per path
# The output should be a matrix with nsim rows and N columns.

brownian_paths <- function(nsim, N){
  # your code
